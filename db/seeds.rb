# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).

# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)


# me = Attendee.create(name:"Sam", phone:"1111111111", status:"Confirmed", relationship:"Maid of Honor", lodgingBudget: nil, eventsBudget: nil)
# flight = Activity.create(name: "Flight", description: "", cost: 500.00, mandatory: true, priority: "HIGH", includeInTotal: true, comment: "", day: "Thursday, Saturday", time: "")
